hash function: sha-256

how to hash json: 
to hash string, hash the bytes repr in utf-8.
to hash int, turn it into base-10 string and hash as string.
for every key-value pair, get the value's hash.
in transactions list, get every dict, then get all value's hashes inside it.
sort the hashes in ascending order, then concat them as raw bytes and hash the result.
